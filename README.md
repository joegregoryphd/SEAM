# Spacecraft Early Analysis Model (SEAM)

**An MBSE Framework for Early Analysis of Spacecraft Behavior**

The Spacecraft Early Analysis Model (SEAM) is an open-source, modular, and reusable framework that enables early functional simulation of spacecraft systems using a model-based systems engineering (MBSE) approach. Designed to support system definition and behavioral analysis in the preliminary design phase, the SEAM allows users to define spacecraft modes, functions, and mission operations, and simulate the resulting behavior using SysML, MATLAB, STK, and Excel.

## 📦 Features

- 🔧 **Modular Design** – Clean separation between Mission, System, Operations, Requirements, and Project modules.
- 📜 **SysML-Based** – Built in Cameo Systems Modeler using SysML 1.5 and executable constructs (fUML).
- 📊 **Simulation Ready** – Integrates with MATLAB and STK to simulate spacecraft behavior based on user-defined Flight Operations Procedures (FOPs).
- 💡 **Behavioral Innovation** – Separates spacecraft *functionality* from *behavior*, allowing flexible ConOps-driven simulations.
- 🔁 **Reusable Template** – Easily adapted to multiple spacecraft missions and architectures.

## 🧠 How It Works

The SEAM models a spacecraft using five key modules:

| Module        | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| **Project**   | Project team, references, data dictionary |
| **Requirements** | Structured, model-based verification of constraints |
| **Mission**   | External entities, mission phases, and orbit/environment profiles |
| **System**    | Logical and functional architecture using modes and functions |
| **Operations**| Flight Operations Procedures (FOPs), including telecommands and decisions |

Each module can be independently modified and updated, but they come together during simulation to provide a comprehensive view of spacecraft behavior.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### 🔽 Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joegregoryphd/SEAM.git
cd SEAM
```

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- [Cameo Systems Modeler](https://www.nomagic.com/products/cameo-systems-modeler)
- [Cameo Simulation Toolkit](https://www.nomagic.com/product-addons/cameo-simulation-toolkit)
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
- [Ansys STK](https://www.ansys.com/products/missions/ansys-stk) (optional but recommended)
- Microsoft Excel

### ▶️ Run a Simulation

1. **Open the Model**  
   Launch Cameo Systems Modeler and open the `SEAM` project.
2. **Define Your System**  
   Customize spacecraft functions, modes, mission profiles, and FOPs.
3. **Run STK Analysis (Optional)**  
   Use the provided MATLAB script to calculate access windows and store them in Excel.
4. **Start Simulation**  
   Run the mission execution activity in Cameo with the Simulation Toolkit.
5. **Visualize**  
   Use the GUI to observe subsystem modes, function execution, and telemetry flows in real time.
